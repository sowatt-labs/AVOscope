# AVOscope
AVOscope is an interactive educational and research-oriented tool for visualizing angle-dependent seismic reflectivity at a two-layer elastic interface. It is designed to help students and practitioners understand AVO behavior, compare exact Zoeppritz solutions with common AVO approximations.

**Acknowledgements:**
> Zoeppritz formulation adapted from the Bruges library
> Based on standard elastic theory (Aki & Richards; Dvorkin et al.)
> AVO classification after Rutherford & Williams (1989)

**Limitations:**
> PP reflectivity only (no PS or converted waves)
> No anisotropy or attenuation
> Synthetic gathers are illustrative, not amplitude-preserved
> Post-critical amplitudes are shown for visualization only

**Disclaimer**
> This tool is intended for learning and conceptual exploration of AVO behavior, not for quantitative reservoir characterization.
